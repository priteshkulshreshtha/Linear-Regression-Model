# Linear Regression Model

This is a Linear Regression Model which is coded in Python using Numpy. I have use a similar convention as that of Sklearn module as it is intutive and easy to learn.

The module is supplied with a synthetic data generation function which produces leanear data giving flexibility of choosing 
- number of samples
- number of features
- number of target variables
- bais
- noise
- random seed

The traianed model can also be plotted in 2D and in an animated 3D from for 2 feature - 1 target feature

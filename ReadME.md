# Linear Regression Model

This is a Linear Regression Model which is coded in Python using Numpy. I have used a similar convention as that of the Sklearn module as it is intuitive and easy to learn.
The module is supplied with a synthetic data generation function which produces linear data giving flexibility of choosing

- number of samples
- number of features
- number of target variables
- bais
- noise
- random seed

The trained model can also be plotted in 2D and in an animated 3D form for 2 feature - 1 target feature.
Other Libraries Used:

- Random
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- mpl_toolkits (3D Plot)
- IPython

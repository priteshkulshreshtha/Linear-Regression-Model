# Logistic Regression Model

This is a Logistic Regression Model which is coded in Python using Numpy. I have used a similar convention as that of the Sklearn module as it is intuitive and easy to learn.
I am using the inbuilt sklearn "make_classification" as a tool to generate the data.

The model uses LogLoss and Gradient Descent Algorithm with early stopping to learn.

The predicted data can be plotted in the form of a heat map using the confusion matrix. The module also provides a way to visualize the decision boundary of the model.

Other Libraries Used:
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- sklearn.metrics
- sklearn.datasets
